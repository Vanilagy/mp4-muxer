# ⚠️ This library is deprecated ⚠️

mp4-muxer has been deprecated in favor of [Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev/), which entirely supersedes it. Mediabunny ships with an even better, easier-to-use, faster and more feature-rich MP4 multiplexer, as well as muxers for many other formats, demuxers, WebCodecs abstractions and more, while keeping the bundle size tiny thanks to a tree-shakable design.

mp4-muxer is no longer being maintained and will not receive any new features or bug fixes.

## I just want to create an MP4 file.

[Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev/) has got you covered. Refer to the following documents to jump right in:

- [Guide: Writing media files](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/writing-media-files)
- [Quick start: Create new media files](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/quick-start#create-new-media-files)

## My code already uses mp4-muxer. What should I do?

No worries. You can easily [migrate to Mediabunny](./MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) in 10 minutes.

If you still need the docs for mp4-muxer, you can find them [here](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mp4-muxer/blob/2c611c5932d3b8054c8968320cf9b6b7db094d30/README.md).
